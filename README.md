# Tetris_React
Classic Puzzle Action

## How it works
The goal of this project is build the puzzle game tetris using react and react hooks. We will maintain the same rules found in the classic video game. A user organises and arrange the set of blocks that fall from the top of the screen. Good old Tetris!
